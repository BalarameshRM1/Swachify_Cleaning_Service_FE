        Professionals agents, contractors, or partners of Swachify or its affiliates. Service
        Professionals do not have the ability to bind or represent Swachify.

        Professionals reserve the right to refuse or discontinue Pro Services if the environment is
        unsafe, unsanitary, or if they experience any disrespectful, abusive, or inappropriate
